  <p>In 2020, we made lots of useful enhancements in all ONLYOFFICE solutions.
   </p>
  <p>For more efficient collaboration, we implemented a new access permission -
    Custom filter that allows hiding the data you don't want to show before sharing
    your spreadsheet. Besides, Sheet View allows creating a filter that only changes
    your view of the data, without affecting your collaborators.</p>
  <p>With document
    comparison, you are now able to quickly compare two docs and see differences between
    them with revision marks, accept/reject/merge the changes.</p>
  <p>In ONLYOFFICE Docs,
    you will find new productivity features such as Pivot tables, conditional formatting
    for viewing, mirror and gutter margins, slicers for formatted tables, endnotes
    and cross-references, new plugins Zotero, Mendeley, Autocomplete, Telegram, HTML,
    Word Count, Typograph, and much more.</p>
  <p>To make ONLYOFFICE more secure, we added
    storage encryption at rest and introduced Private Rooms, protected workplaces
    where every symbol you type is encrypted using the unbreakable AES-256 algorithm,
    even if you are co-editing documents with your teammates in real-time. For now,
    it's the first version of ONLYOFFICE Private Rooms and we're planning
    to further develop and improve it.</p>
  <p>We presented ONLYOFFICE Groups released
    under Apache 2.0 what allows modifying and distributing it without limitations.
    It can be easily deployed in a few steps and integrated into any product ecosystem.
    This makes ONLYOFFICE Groups an ideal solution for hosting providers who would
    like to bring their customers the most complete in-browser collaboration platform.r
    nAlong with multiple enhancements for the existing integrations, especially with
    Nextcloud and ownCloud, the last year brought new connectors that allow integrating
    ONLYOFFICE Docs with other platforms, namely for HumHub, Plone, and Nuxeo. </p>
  <p>
    We're now working on multi-functional forms. And we don't talk about these
    simple forms for making polls. Instead, we are creating a tool for working with
    complex online documents that will allow quickly building any document template.</p>
