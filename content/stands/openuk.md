  <p>With a focus on <b>Skills</b>, <b>Security</b>, and <b>Sustainability</b>, we started 2022 by celebrating the <a href="#honours"><b>New Year’s Honours List</b></a> and launching the ten <a href="#founders"><b>Future Founders Training Sessions</b></a> set up by Matt Barker our Entrepreneur in Residence, and the Founders Forum.  The training sessions are ongoing with the next session happening on <b>12 noon GMT 25th February</b>.  We are also offering a <b>Mentoring Program</b> to a small group of UK based individuals.</p>
