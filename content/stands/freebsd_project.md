description: 'FreeBSD is an open source operating system descended from the Unix developed
  at the University of California, Berkeley that became an open source project in
  1993 with several hundred active committers from across the globe. Today, FreeBSD
  provides a copy-free modern operating system that is up-to-date and scalable, offers
  high-performance, security, and advanced networking. It is used for personal workstations,
  Internet servers, embedded devices, routers, and firewalls. The FreeBSD packages
  collection includes popular software like: Apache web server, GNOME, KDE, X.org,
  Python, Firefox and over 33,000 software suites. The FreeBSD community is comprised
  of a global community of end users, developers and companies large and small working
  together to further the OS.'

new_this_year: 'Since our last visit to FOSDEM, the FreeBSD Project has made strides
  in a number of areas.  The Project made the transition to git making it easier for
  folks to contribute. Great improvements were made in the graphics stack, as well
  as, to browser and video conferencing capabilities to allow for support on most
  any contemporary laptop. There is now better ARM64 support for servers and embedded
  devices like Raspberry Pi. The Project switched to a new OpenZFS upstream that supports
  FreeBSD and Linux. The removal of obsolete GPL components has been completed along
  with many network stack improvements. Finally, there is a lot of new online content
  to help folks get started and ask questions about FreeBSD including: FreeBSD Office
  Hours, FreeBSD Fridays, and several developers have hosted twitch live streaming
  sessions.'
