  <p>In early 2021 we will be releasing the 2.0 version of the software,
  which will be our biggest release yet. Version 2.0 includes an overhaul of the GUI,
  dramatic performance improvements, integration with Prometheus, and ntop for a more
  holistic approach in monitoring, among others. Since the last FOSDEM, we also released
  our Documentation and Localization contribution programs.</p>
showcase: |
  <p>Our stand will be interesting for hobbyists building their homelab or IT professionals who are managing their organization's infrastructure. In our stand we'll share some insights of what we learned in the field, explain some of our problem-solving approach in the job and show some demos. We'll also share how we are trying to bridge the gap between IT Ops and DevOps teams &mdash; two teams that historically have been working in silos &mdash; to improve collaboration.</p>
