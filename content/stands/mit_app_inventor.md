  MIT App Inventor is an open source (Apache Software License 2.0) platform
  for anyone to build their own mobile apps. The MIT App Inventor project seeks to
  democratize software development by empowering all people, especially young people,
  to move from technology consumption to technology creation. Currently it targets
  Android with an iOS version in the works, and is used by over one million people
  worldwide every year. Recently, we introduced a suite of on-device machine learning
  extensions to allow people to learn about training and evaluating custom ML models
  without sending data to any third parties.

  <p>In the last year we have implemented support for dictionaries in the
  App Inventor language. We have introduced support for newer Android APIs. These
  facilities make it easier to interoperate with JSON and XML data. We are also developing
  a feature called Visible Component Extensions, which will allow any developer to
  extend App Inventor's capabilities with custom views. We also recently introduced
  a suite of on-device machine learning extensions to allow people to learn about
  training and evaluating custom ML models without sending data to any third parties
  and have produced curricula for teachers to use to teach about artificial intelligence
  (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai-with-mit-app-inventor). These materials are
  freely available for anyone to use under the CC 4.0 BY-SA license. In 2020 we introduced
  improved support for using App Inventor for mobile development on Chromebooks. New
  this year is also a translation into Lithuanian.</p>

  <p>Come to the App Inventor stand at FOSDEM to learn about how you can quickly
  build your own mobile apps, how you can contribute to the project, and how you can
  create and publish your own extensions for other developers. You can also talk with
  members of the current development team about how to contribute to App Inventor
  through Google Summer of Code. Join our worldwide community of developers to enable
  anyone to build a mobile app!</p>
