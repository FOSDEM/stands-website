  ReactOS is a modern open source operating system based on the Windows XP/2003 design.
  It was written from scratch with the goal of full compatibility with Windows applications and drivers, as well as a similar user interface so that most users can find their way around immediately.
  The source code for the entire system is freely available under either the GNU GPL, BSD or similar license.<br>
  <br>
  ReactOS's unique ability to use applications and drivers developed for Windows makes it the open source operating system with the broadest hardware and software support.
  In addition, it is based on the design of the NT kernel, which makes it scalable, portable and performant.
  In addition to the well-known Win32 support, this also enables other subsystems, for example POSIX, or the DOS/Win16 VDM, which is already under development.

  <p>Here is our most notable changes since the FOSDEM 2021:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>64bit build is now more mature, builds and boots in VMs now and even on some hardware.</li>
    <li>Improved HAL library for APIC interrupt controller.</li>
    <li>SMP improvements are being done, but not yet ready to be demonstrated.</li>
    <li>Security subsystem in the kernel sees improvements for the first time in a decade.</li>
    <li>Memory manager improvements, allowing the boot from NTFS filesystem (still experimental though) and using FS drivers from Microsoft.</li>
    <li>Multiple monitors support.</li>
    <li>Huge improvements in input and display of CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) languages.</li>
  </ul>
showcase: |
  <p>We are a one of a kind project aiming to recreate Windows&nbsp;NT from ground up, cleanly and legally.
  All code is freely available for anyone to tinker with.</p>
  <p>We will show on our stand what was and is possible with our quite limited manpower
  and give a little insight to what can happen when a few developers are getting paid for a few months,
  how much the whole project can improve just by support on paid work base for a short time period.</p>
  <p>Of course we can and will try to answer all questions our visitors have regarding the project,
  the current status and what we will expect to happen soon.
  We have still some big improvements left to come soon and plan to show some of these live in a preview.</p>
  <p>We will show working real hardware, real Windows applications running and all with real Windows 3rd party closed source drivers being used.
  All on a FOSS Windows like system.</p>
