    Kiwi TCMS is the leading open source test management system for both
    manual & automated testing. It has been made by testers and licensed
    under GPLv2.

    Our mission is to transform the testing process by making
    it more organized, transparent & accountable for everyone on your team.

    Kiwi TCMS is used during software testing and quality assurance to collect
    information about what, when and how has been tested. This information is
    later used when making a go/no-go decision before a release, monitoring and
    planning the workload of the QA team or answering questions like
    "How did we test this?" and "Why didn't we catch this bug before?"!
