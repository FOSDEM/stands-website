description: "The LibreSOC Project is an ethically developed processor, based on OpenPOWER,\
  \ intended for use in smartphones netbooks tablets chromebooks and Industrial Embedded\
  \ SBC products.  There will be no DRM, no TPM, and no backdoor spying co-processors.\r\
  \n\r\nThe entire source code, traditionally known to OEMs as a \"Board Support Package\"\
  , will not only be available free of charge under Libre Licenses, right to the BIOS\
  \ level, the hardware HDL will also likewise be available (and is already available\
  \ as it is developed).  Access to a full BSP with greatly simplified drivers for\
  \ 3D and Video is a huge cost and time saving for businesses.\r\n\r\nIt's also a\
  \ fantastic educational and research base.  Which would you rather have: a Pi-style\
  \ SBC where the GPU boots the processor from a closed source binary and kids are\
  \ taught that to play videos they must pay a license fee for a closed binary decoder,\
  \ or would you prefer that they are able to get the full source of even the hardware\
  \ and boot the entire processor including the GPU and VPU on a $200 FPGA and learn\
  \ how it works?"

new_this_year: LibreSOC has extra funding from NLnet, for the Video driver, and for
  a MESA 3D driver as well.  We are also funded to make a 180 nm test ASIC which might
  be available in January.  We also have plans to submit an NLnet grant request to
  make a 5 port Gigabit Ethernet Hub processor (running OpenWRT and LibreCMC).  Ridiculous
  amount going on.
showcase: To learn that there exists an alternative to proprietary processors from
  Intel, ARM and AMD, and that yes, they can actually be part of making that happen.
