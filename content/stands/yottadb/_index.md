  YottaDB is a language-agnostic hierarchical key-value database that
  scales from small system-on-chip designs to large servers. Languages are supported
  through \u201Cwrappers\u201D with support currently available for C, Go, M, Perl,
  and Rust, with support for node.js and Python expected soon. Other wrappers from
  the community allow YottaDB to be a JSON data store. Octo provides JDBC / SQL-92
  based access for reporting and analytics with read-write access support coming
  in 2021. All our work is 100% free / open source.

  <p> 
    Since FOSDEM 2020, we have added production grade support for JDBC
    / SQL-92 access to the database for analytics and reporting, as well as production
    grade support for access from the Rust language.
    <br>
    We have made numerous smaller enhancements such as simpler installation, enhanced 
    troubleshooting tools, performance enhancements,
    and of course (like every software project) bug fixes.

showcase: |
  <p>
    Based on a mature code base (in daily production use since 1986; continuously
    invested in and evolving since), YottaDB is a language-agnostic hierarchical key-value
    database to which all common NoSQL and SQL use cases map well. Its robustness, scalability
    and security are demonstrated by the fact that it is the database of record for
    some of the largest real-time core-banking applications in the world, as well as
    a nation scale electronic health record system. In Belgium, it is the database of
    record for the University of Antwerp library system!
