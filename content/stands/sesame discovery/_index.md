    This stand will show off the open design of the Sesame Discovery chassis - allowing individuals, organizations, and companies to have an "datacenter in a box" in a desk side form factor. With the ability to plug in 4-12 nodes of scalable computing - the Discovery can be used in a variety of projects in any location without the need of a data center. From kubernetes to a blender render farm to medical research, the possibilities are endless. Imagine being able to run thousands of containers under 2000 watts?

Visitors to the stand will also learn about the Open Compute Project (https://opencompute.org/) - a consortium of data center companies working in concert to build an open data center. The Discovery chassis will provide an open window how this project works and how we are building generic data centers with no vendor lock ins.

Lastly, visitors can appreciate the role of the circular data center market segment. Not only can you build great computational power that you can plug into your home, lab, or classroom but the hardware is based on a supply chain of re-certified top tier data center components from first tier companies like Facebook and Google. By using this supply chain we can lower our carbon footprint because we are extending the life of valuable equipment that already exists rather than making new ones. The circular economy directly relies on open firmware and open hardware as part of its business.

showcase: |
    The Discovery project is a demonstration of what an ecosystem that consists of hardware companies, software companies, and the circular economy working in concert can do. Combining the collaboration of data center companies, with open system design, and open firmware, supplied by a carbon friendly supply chain of hardware components - the new data centers we build will be carbon friendly, avoid vendor lock-in, whose waste output can be re-purposed to provide heat and energy to neighborhoods and finally can scale from a home office or cubicle to the traditional computer room.

Come to our stand to hear about the possibilities that can be achieved through juxtaposition of community, openness, and low carbon supply chain.

new_this_year: |
    The Discovery project has been in existence for about two years but is relatively new to the open source and open hardware community. In that time frame, in addition to the classic 5 port switch included in the chassis, we've added the ability to add a true 100GBE 32 port white box switch on the side panel. This will allow the ability to have even more nodes into chassis but also have a true data center networking all within the chassis.

We have other active designs that are not associated with Discovery but part of a family of open designed chassis that we would also be sharing at the booth as well as exciting work with partners whose open software projects will be designed to work on our open hardware - from edge computing to Kubernetes to AI - come chat with us on what open hardware can do!
