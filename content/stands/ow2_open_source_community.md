description: "Established in 2007 as a non-profit organisation, OW2 is a \u201Ccommunity\
  \ of communities\u201D. Our mission is to make freely available a portfolio of open\
  \ source software for enterprise information systems in domains such as middleware,\
  \ open cloud, big data, BPM, security and privacy, software engineering, collaboration,\
  \ etc. The OW2 code base hosts dozens of open source projects such as ASM, AuthzForce,\
  \ CLIF, DocDoku, FusionDirectory, GLPI, JORAM, Knowage, LemonLDAP:NG, Lutece, OCS\
  \ Inventory, Petals ESB, Prelude, ProActive, Rocket.Chat, SAT4J, SeedStack, Sympa,\
  \ Telosys, Waarp, WebLab and XWiki. \r\nOW2 was one of the exhibitors at FOSDEM\
  \ in 2017, 2018 and 2020. \r\nIn our experience, our stand operates as a focus for\
  \ our members, contributors and anybody who wishes to reach out to us. As explained\
  \ on our website, seven projects from our code base participated last year. Each\
  \ project contributed in running our stand alternately during the two days of FOSDEM,\
  \ making it a very busy and lively exhibition space.  This year the virtual booth\
  \ will again be shared between project leaders who will take turn to answer questions,\
  \ chat with visitors and run project demonstrations.\r\nIn 2021, OW2\u2019s drive\
  \ to contribute to the sustainability of the European open source ecosystem will\
  \ be illustrated by two recently launched initiatives: one is the analysis of open\
  \ source project\u2019s Market Readiness Levels, the other the OW2 OSS Good Governance\
  \ initiative a framework for appropriate usage of open source software."

new_this_year: "We will be happy to showcase on OW2 virtual booth several new projects\
  \ that have joined the OW2 code base during the passed year :  OCS Inventory, Jeka,\
  \ DECIDE, Fuyuko, Device Farmer, LDAP Toolbox. \r\n\r\nThe virtual booth will also\
  \ introduce two strategic initiatives recently launched by OW2 and new to FOSDEM\
  \ in 2021:  the analysis of open source project\u2019s Market Readiness Levels,\
  \ and the OW2 OSS Good Governance initiative, a framework for appropriate usage\
  \ of open source software. These initiatives aim at contributing to the sustainability\
  \ of the European open source ecosystem:\r\n    \u2022 Market Readiness Levels\r\
  \nApplied to all 25 OW2 mature projects, the Market Readiness Levels scoring assesses\
  \ the processes, key metrics and business resources of our open source projects\
  \ and rates them on a market readiness scale similar to that of the NASA\u2019s\
  \ Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) rating. This synthetic approach has benefits\
  \ for the developers as it provides them a blueprint for progressing, and for the\
  \ users as it helps them make informed decision from a corporate rather than technical\
  \ perspective. \r\n    \u2022 OSS Good Governance initiative \r\nThis initiative\
  \ addresses the needs of large end-users and digital service companies to better\
  \ manage consumption of, and contribution to OSS. We will showcase the Open Source\
  \ Good Governance Resource Center, a platform where EU users can discover, and a\
  \ blueprint for implementing open source competency centers (aka OSPOs). The scope\
  \ of the initiative goes beyond mere vulnerability and license compliance management,\
  \ the initiative aims to make C-level executive aware of the benefits of open source\
  \ and of supporting the European open source ecosystem."
showcase: "Visit OW2\u2019s virtual stand and learn more about what OW2 is, discover\
  \ an open and independent community of developers dedicated to the creation of new\
  \ technology and to sustainable open source software. Find out why and how you could\
  \ be involved, as a contributor, a project leader or an initiative stakeholder,\
  \ or a supporter. \r\n\r\nOW2 project leaders will take turn to answer questions,\
  \ chat with visitors and run project demonstrations. Check out the schedule of the\
  \ OW2 virtual booth and come visit us, discuss with our projects leaders, and discover\
  \ state-of-the-art technologies in various fields such as middleware, infrastructure\
  \ projects, generic business applications, cloud computing platforms, etc. \r\n\
  The OW2 Management Office will be on stand-by to explain OW2\u2019s new strategic\
  \ initiatives: open source project Market Readiness Initiatives and the OW2 OSS\
  \ Good Governance initiative."
