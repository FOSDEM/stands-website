description: "OpenMandriva is a 100% community controlled Linux distribution.\r\n\
  With (as of December 2020) Plasma 5.20.4, KDE Frameworks 5.77, Qt 5.12.2 and LibreOffice\
  \ 7.1, it is one of the most current distributions available.\r\nOpenMandriva was\
  \ the first Linux distribution to switch to a clang based toolchain. In the current\
  \ version, even the kernel is built with clang 11.\r\nWhile the primary focus of\
  \ OpenMandriva is on the desktop, its repositories also contain a state of the art\
  \ server stack."

new_this_year: "OpenMandriva has come a long way in porting to new hardware: In addition\
  \ to the traditional x86_64 distribution and the extra version optimized specifically\
  \ for AMD Ryzen processors, OpenMandriva now runs on Pinebook Pro, Cubox Pulse,\
  \ various ARM devboards, and UEFI capable Aarch64 servers. A phone stack running\
  \ on PinePhone is in the works (and ready for initial use). A RISC-V port is also\
  \ in the works (presently running in qemu) and should be ready for daily use shortly\
  \ after we can get our hands on Hifive Unmatched boards.\r\nWith the 4.2 release\
  \ done, our main focus has moved to 5.0 - which will bring many improvements to\
  \ the core system, such as making crosscompiling and targeting multiple architectures\
  \ easier than ever."
showcase: "OpenMandriva is aiming at being easy to get into for newbies, while being\
  \ one of the most innovative distributions for developers. We were the first to\
  \ switch to the clang toolchain, and are working on new interesting developer features\
  \ for our 5.0 release.\r\nOpenMandriva can work on x86_64 systems as well as aarch64\
  \ (not sharing some other distributions' limitation to UEFI compliant aarch64 server\
  \ platforms), and can run as a desktop, workstation, server, or - since the advent\
  \ of OpenMandriva on PinePhone - smartphone.\r\nYou may want to pay us a visit if\
  \ you're interested in getting into Linux or you're looking for a project that can\
  \ use your help as a volunteer.\r\n\r\nOpenMandriva is not based on any other distribution.\
  \ Contributors who are so inclined can do more than just submit a new theme or add\
  \ an extra package."
