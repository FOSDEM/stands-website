description: "YottaDB is a language-agnostic hierarchical key-value database that\
  \ scales from small system-on-chip designs to large servers. Languages are supported\
  \ through \u201Cwrappers\u201D with support currently available for C, Go, M, Perl,\
  \ and Rust, with support for node.js and Python expected soon. Other wrappers from\
  \ the community allow YottaDB to be a JSON data store. Octo provides JDBC / SQL-92\
  \ based access for reporting and analytics with read-write access support coming\
  \ in 2021. All our work is 100% free / open source."

new_this_year: Since FOSDEM 2020, we have added production grade support for JDBC
  / SQL-92 access to the database for analytics and reporting, as well as production
  grade support for access from the Rust language. We have made numerous smaller enhancements
  such as simpler installation, enhanced troubleshooting tools, performance enhancements,
  and of course (like every software project) bug fixes.
showcase: Based on a mature code base (in daily production use since 1986, but continuously
  invested in and evolving since), YottaDB is a hierarchical key-value database on
  which all common NoSQL and SQL user cases map well. Its robustness, scalability
  and security are demonstrated by the fact that it is the database of record for
  some of the largest real-time core-banking applications in the world, as well as
  a nation scale electronic health record system. In Belgium, it is the database of
  record for the University of Antwerp library system!
